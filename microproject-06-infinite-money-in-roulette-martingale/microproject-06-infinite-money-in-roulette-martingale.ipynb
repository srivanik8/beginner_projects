    "## Data Simulation: A Martingale Betting System\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"martingale\" is a betting strategy where, after every loss, your next met is made so that a win will always recover all of previous losses.  In the game of Roulette, a wheel with 38 slots is spun and a ball is placed into the spinning wheel.  As the spinning wheel slows down, the ball will land in one of the 38 slots with equal probability.  Each of the slots are labeled with a number **and** a color.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you place a bet on the color \"red\" or \"black\", **the bet is \"1:1\" bet**.  A \"1:1\" bet means you are awarded with $1 for every $1 you bet if you win (plus you retain your original bet) or you lose your entire bet if you lose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the martingale betting strategy to the game of Roulette would involve the following betting strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initially, you bet a small amount (ex: $1.00) that the ball will land on \"red\".\n",
    "- A game of roulette is played.  Based on the result of the game:\n",
    "  - **If the ball lands on red**, you won your bet!  You made $1.00 and can repeat again.\n",
    "  - **Each time you lose**, you double your bet!  You will initially lose the $1.00, but doubling your bet to $2.00 will make up for that initial loss when you win.  (If you continue to lose, you'll bet $4.00 to make up for the $1 + $2 lost bets, then $8.00 to make up for the $1 + $2 + $4 lost bets, then $16, then $32, and so on.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table outlines this strategy and your total eventual winnings:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Scenario | Previous Losses | Winning Bet | Total Winnings |\n",
    "| -------- | --------------: | ------: | -------------: |\n",
    "| You bet red, and win | -- | $1.00 | +$1.00 |\n",
    "| You win after losing once | -$1.00 | $2.00 | +$1.00 |\n",
    "| You win after losing twice | -$3.00 | $4.00 | +$1.00 |\n",
    "| You win after losing three times | -$7.00 | $8.00 | +$1.00 |\n",
    "| You win after losing four times | -$15.00 | $16.00 | +$1.00 |\n",
    "| You win after losing five times | -$31.00 | $32.00 | +$1.00 |\n",
    "| You win after losing six times | -$63.00 | $64.00 | +$1.00 |\n",
    "| You win after losing seven times | -$127.00 | $128.00 | +$1.00 |\n",
    "| ... | ... | ... | +$1.00 |\n",
    "\n",
    "In the table, you will see that every win will **ALWAYS** result in a total winnings of $1.00 -- even if you just lost 7 or more times in a row!  Proponents of the martingale betting system will tell you that they have mathematically proven way that you will make an **infinite increasing amount of money** so long as you play the game long enough!\n",
