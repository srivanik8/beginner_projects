    "The Bechdel Test is a simple way of measuring the representation of women in a film or other work of fiction.  A work earns points for each of three criteria:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. who talk to each other,\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The test was popularized by Alison Bechdel's 1985 comic strip called \"The Rule\" and has grown in popularity as a simple way to measure the representation of women in works of fiction.  The website [BechdelTest.com](BechdelTest.com) provides both a searchable database and a publicly-available API that includes over 10,000 films and their Bechdel Test ratings, allowing users to explore and analyze patterns in gender representation in cinema.\n",
