    "In the Journal of Vision Research (June 2000), Andrew Stockman and Lindsay T. Sharpe's *[\"The spectral sensitivities of the middle- and long-wavelength-sensitive cones derived from measurements in observers of known genotype\"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698900000213)* presents an incredibly detailed study of the sensitivity that the three types of cones have to various wavelengths of light.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their work quantifies that **the human eye is far more sensitive to green and red light than to blue light**.  Given this finding, this MicroProject will explore the hypothesis that we may be able hide data by slightly changing the blue components of pixels in an image without those changes being detected visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Algorithm: \"Blue Steganography\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the background research and hypothesis above, we will implement a way to detect \"Blue Steganography\" in an image.  A few basic foundations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To minimize any visual impact, we never want to change the blue (`b`) value of any pixel by more than +/- 1 (ex: if the original value `b` value is `153`, our final value should be `152`, `153`, or `154` -- at most only adding or subtracting one to `153`).  Larger changes than this would almost certainly be easily detectable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To store information in this way, we will hide a message by checking if the `b` value is an **even number** or an **odd number**.  Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will consider **all columns** but **only the first 27 rows** of any image (`y=0` to `y=26`).\n",
    "2. **Exactly one** `b` value in the first 27 rows of each column will be an **even value**.   All other `b` values in the first 27 rows will be an odd value.\n",
    "3. The **row** (y-value) in which the even value was found will represent the letter in our secret, hidden message.\n",
    "    - The even `b` value in the first row of the image, `y=0`, represents an `A`,\n",
    "    - The even `b` value in row `y=1` represents a `B`,\n",
    "    - The even `b` value in row `y=2` represents a `C`,\n",
    "    - ...and so on, until...\n",
    "    - The even `b` value in row `y=25` represents a `Z`, and\n",
    "    - The even `b` value in row `y=26` represents a space (` `).\n",
    "\n",
    "*(This is only one possible steganography algorithm among many, but it should succeed in being an unnoticeable change to an image -- and it should be simple to process!)*"
